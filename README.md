### About the Project

#### This was a password generator project for a DevOps manager at a financial institution. The project scope sought to provide an application which would generate strong, randomly selected passwords providing greater security for sensitive customer data. The application was to have a clean and polished user interface rendering responsively across a variety of devices. 

#### Completion of the acceptance criteria implemented the following items:
#####   - When "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user is prompted for password criteria. 
#####   - When prompted for a the length of the password, the user is prompted to choose at least 8 and no more than 128 characters.
#####   - When prompted for character types to be included in the password, the user is prompted to input whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters. 
#####   - When the user answers each prompt, the input is validated wherein at least one character type is selected.
#####   - When all prompts are answered, a password matching the criteria selected is generated and displayed in the application's UI.
